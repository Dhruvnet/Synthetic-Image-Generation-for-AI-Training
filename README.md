# 🔬 Synthetic Image Generation for AI Training

This project focuses on **synthetic image generation** to enhance AI training by creating high-quality and diverse visual data. The model improves robustness in dynamic environments such as **surveillance systems**, **autonomous vehicles**, and **weather condition simulations**. We also integrate cybersecurity safeguards to protect against **adversarial attacks**, **deepfakes**, and **privacy threats**.

## 🧠 Problem Definition

> Existing AI models struggle with real-world inconsistencies and lack diverse datasets.  
Our goal is to develop a **robust, scalable, and high-resolution synthetic image generation pipeline** that supports:
- Multi-object environments
- High content preservation
- Dynamic scene transitions

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✔️ Realistic day-to-night image translation using **CycleGAN**
- ✔️ Simulating weather conditions like fog, rain, and snow with **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)**
- ✔️ Resolution enhancement using **Real-ESRGAN**
- ✔️ Maintain object consistency and transition realism
- ✔️ Include user-controlled environmental customization

---

## 🧪 Research Gaps

- ❌ Lack of output diversity (e.g., only one-to-one image translation)
- ❌ Low-resolution or blurry image outputs
- ❌ Dependence on paired datasets
- ❌ Limited versatility in real-time applications

![FINAL INCREASE SIZE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4877971-2318-4b0d-abe6-ac805cbe581e)


**Core Modules:**
- `CycleGAN` – for day ↔ night transformations  
- `CVAE` – for weather simulation (rain, fog, snow)  
- `Real-ESRGAN` – for super-resolution  
- `User Interface` – to control intensity and parameters for custom dataset creation
